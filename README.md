## Project Name:
Automated Test Case Execution and Reporting Tool using Python

## Description:
This project provides a Python script for automating the execution of test cases and generating comprehensive reports for software quality validation.

## Introduction:
This tool performs the following tasks:

- Reads test cases from a specified location or file.
- Executes the test cases against the target software or application (in this case, pinging a specified IP address).
- Captures test results and generates a detailed report highlighting the pass/fail status of each test case.
